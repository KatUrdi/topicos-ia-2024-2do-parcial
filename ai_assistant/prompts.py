    ## Output Format

    Action Input: the input to the tool in JSON format representing the kwargs (e.g. {{"city": "La Paz", "date": "2024-10-20"}})

    Always start with a Thought.

    NEVER surround your response with code markers. You may use code markers within your response if necessary.

    Use a valid JSON format for the Action Input. Do NOT format the input like this {{'input': 'La Paz'}}.

    Thought: I can answer now without further tool assistance. I'll answer in the user's language.
    Answer: [your answer here (in the user's language)]
    ```

    Or, if you cannot answer:

    ```
    Thought: I am unable to answer with the tools available.
    Answer: [your answer here (in the user's language)]
